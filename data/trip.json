There were numerous pale, yellow iguanas along the trail around the island. Snorkeling was also on the itinerary. I got to see pufferfish, sea lions, and many other colorful fish.",

When arriving to Isabela, it was clear that it was a less inhabited island, compared to the previous ones. There were still hotels, restaurants, and grocery stores, but being the farthest inhabited island from mainland Ecuador, the residents of Isabela need to be more conscious of supplies.",
